## What's this about?

Reflectify offers a bunch of extension methods to provide information such as the properties or fields a type exposes and metadata about those members, and many other details about classes, records and interfaces. It supports all major .NET versions and even understands explicltly implemented properties or properties coming from default interface implementations, a C# 8 feature.

## What's so special about that?

Nothing really, but it offers that functionality through a content-only NuGet package. In other words, you can use this package in your own packages, without the need to tie yourself to the Reflectify package. Oh, and it's used by [an open-source project](https://fluentassertions.com/) with over 400 million downloads.

## How do I use it?

Simple, to get the properties of a type, add the `Reflectify` NuGet package and use

```csharp
using Reflectify;

var properties = typeof(SuperClass).GetProperties(
    MemberKind.Public | MemberKind.ExplicitlyImplemented | MemberKind.DefaultInterfaceProperties);
```

You can take any of the options `Public`, `Internal`, `ExplictlyImplemented` and `DefaultInterfaceProperties`.

If you need the fields, use `GetFields` (which obviously cannot be explicitly implemented, nor be part of interfaces), and if you need the members, use `GetMembers`. You can also request individual members by name, like `GetProperty("Name", MemberKind.Public)` or `GetField("Name", MemberKind.Internal)`.

To get more metadata from a `PropertyInfo`, you can use extensions methods like:

* `IsExplictlyImplemented`
* `IsIndexer`
* `HasAttribute` and `HasAttributeInHierarchy`

Similarly, you can find indexers using `FindIndexers`, conversion operators through `FindImplicitConversionOperators` and `FindExplicitConversionOperators`, and methods via `FindMethod`, `FindParameterlessMethod` and `HasMethod`.

Other extension methods act on `Type` directly and include:

* `IsDerivedFromOpenGeneric` and `GetClosedGenericInterfaces`
* Various `HasAttribute`, `HasAttributeInHierarchy` and `GetMatchingAttributes` overloads, with and without additional filtering.
* `OverridesEquals` to determine if a type implements value semantics
* `IsSameOrInherits` to see if a type is the same as or derives from another (open-generic) type
* `IsCompilerGenerated` and `HasFriendlyName` to see if a type is (partially) generated by the compiler, like records, tuples, etc.
* `IsAnonymous`, `IsTuple`, `IsRecord`, `IsRecordClass`,`IsRecordStruct`, `IsKeyValuePair` to find these types.

Additionally, Reflectify offers some helpers such as

* `NullableOrActualType` to get the actual type of a nullable type or the type itself if it's not nullable.
